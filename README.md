# SCRP â€“ Supermarket Comparison & Price Scraper

**SCRP** is a python-based tool that scrapes, parses, and compares product prices and promotions from major supermarket chains in Israel. By fetching live price feeds directly from supermarket APIs, SCRP enables users to easily compare prices and find the best deals at nearby stores.
